# Vigenère Encryption Password Manager

This project implements a simple password manager using classic Vigenère cipher encryption to securely store and manage passwords. It allows users to add new passwords, view all encrypted passwords, retrieve specific passwords for services, and supports custom alphabets for encryption.

## Features

- Choose an encryption key
- Add new passwords with encryption
- View all encrypted passwords
- Retrieve and decrypt passwords for specific services
- Customizable encryption alphabet
